### Sentiment Analysis
We tried to monitor the trend of different Facebook political fan pages from 20150101 to 20170408. I applied the "VADER" in
"nltk" module to derive the sentiment score of each post during the period. An additional R script was done to plot sentiment
changes of different Facebook pages.

### tf-idf Cosine Similarity Matching
To detect fake news spreading among Facebook fan pages we are interested. I matched all of their post from 20150101 to 
20170408 to fake news reported by fact check data.

### Others
Python Scripts used to assist data processing.
