## Fake News on Facebook

Fake News has been considered a serious problem as it forms false belief and threaten the integrity of a democracy. The problem could be even more damaging on Facebook, which provides not only a platform for spreading fake news, but also an algorithm to people that tend to "like" the article feeded to them. 


### tf-idf Cosine Similarity Matching
To detect fake news spreading among Facebook fan pages we are interested. I matched all of their post from 20150101 to 
20170408 to fake news reported by fact check data.

### Fake News Topic Exploration
Before trying to answer the spread of fake news and their influences on Facebook, we started with exploring their discussion topics and the words that are brought up together with certain politicians and issues.



## Sentiment Analysis
We tried to monitor the trend of different Facebook political fan pages from 20150101 to 20170408. I applied the "VADER" in
"nltk" module to derive the sentiment score of each post during the period. An additional R script was done to plot sentiment
changes of different Facebook pages.
